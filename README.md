# Quiz Challenge

This weekly challenge is quiz game with timer.
For this project first I created the Html and CSS with 5 questions each of them with 4 possible answers.
The quiz starts with start button and included restart button in the last question to start again the quiz. In the JavaScript I included the Math random function to get aleatory functionality so every time the user do the quiz the questions change the order.
